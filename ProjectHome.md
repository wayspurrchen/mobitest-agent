Mobile apps that measure mobile web performance from real mobile devices.
The apps act as agents to a [webpagetest](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/private-instances/) server, a separate open-source project.

A [hosted version of mobitest](http://mobitest.akamai.com/) can be found on the [Akamai website](http://mobitest.akamai.com/).
Mobitest also powers Steve Souders' [Mobile HTTP Archive](http://mobile.httparchive.org/).

See the README files inside the sub-folders for more detailed build, install and usage instructions.
